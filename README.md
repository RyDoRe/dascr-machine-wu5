# Project
This is the successor of my previous project [dARts](https://github.com/patrickhener/dARts). I chost to rewrite it using go as a backend language. I also refined the Arduino sketch. Also I spiced it up a little and did a full redesign. It is now called `DaSCR - Machine` and will be one of three projects within the `DaSCR range`.

It is a production grade soft dart machine which is made out of an Arduino, a Raspberry Pi and LÃ¶wen Darts machine components and wood.

# Detailed documentation
A detailed documentation on how to build it, set that up and use it you can find at [dascr.org](https://dascr.org).
